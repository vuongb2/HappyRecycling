**Problem from SDG: Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**

*People want to recycle but have a difficult time understanding and identifying what items can be actually recycled.*

Problem description:

Recycling is one of the easiest ways for us to work together to ensure that natural resources and energy are being saved and not going to waste. By reducing, reusing, and recycling correctly we can prevent environmental degradation, climate change, and landfill waste from occurring any further (SDG, 2022). There are a few challenges that make recycling difficult and unachievable for many. One of the biggest barriers that stops people from recycling is because they are unsure of what can be recycled. According to the World Economic Forum, SAP, and Qualtrics, the survey study revealed that many people felt confused when it comes to recycling. “Only about 35% of people actually recycle” (Thomas et. al, 2022). Recycling programs may be different since they vary from location to location. Due to these challenges, aspirational recycling easily occurs. 

92% of all plastics, 34% of paper and cardboard products, and 63% of all glass is improperly thrown away as garbage instead of recycling, due to lack of awareness or inaccessibility (March et al. 2022). This improper waste management ultimately leads to increased waste accumulation in landfills, which contributes to: 

- Environmental pollution: contaminating soil, water bodies, air, and wildlife. Landfills can become breeding grounds for dangerous diseases as well.
- Depletion of natural resources:  without reusing materials, we are depleting expensive natural resources and impacting our economy
- Habitat destruction: landfills take up space, leading to plant, animal, and marine death and lowering biodiversity.
- Increased greenhouse gas emissions: accelerates climate change.

Which ultimately exacerbates climate change and negatively impacts our sustainability (Group, 2022 & OSHA, 2023). Inconvenience is another common challenge in recycling (Wood, 2021). Not having access to recycling can be a struggle, which is one of the many reasons why people avoid recycling.  According to Jiaying Zhao, a professor that focuses on sustainability, believes that signs with images of recyclable items are more beneficial than simply having just text (McCue, 2019). If disposal signs or posters are not understood by people, this will create confusion and lead to aspirational recycling. 

Existing solutions and websites that target these common challenges in recycling mainly list the items that are recyclable and include basic questions and answers. Overall, the content may be there, but it is hard for users to navigate and understand the different types of items that can be recycled with very little images and photos. In addition, many websites do not provide recycling information and programs for certain locations, which is not useful for those who are in an unfamiliar area or individuals that are traveling.
